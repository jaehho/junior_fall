# Project 4: Gradient Boosted Trees

<https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>

Using California Housing Dataset

- replicate the analysis, including the plots

- Repeat analysis on ... dataset
- Use the built-in functions that come with the xgboost package to tune the model and optimize performance
- determine feature importance
- Thorough analysis of the results
  - Discuss the feature importance metrics. Do they make sense? Are there any features that are non-intuitive?\
- Do an additional feature importance analysis using Shapley values and the `shap` python package. Compare the results to the XGBoost results.
