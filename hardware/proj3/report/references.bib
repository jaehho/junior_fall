Lyrics:
We‚Äôre no strangers to love
You know the rules and so do I
A full commitment‚Äôs what I‚Äôm thinking of
You wouldn‚Äôt get this from any other guy

I just wanna tell you how I‚Äôm feeling
Gotta make you understand

Never gonna give you up
Never gonna let you down
Never gonna run around and desert you
Never gonna make you cry
Never gonna say goodbye
Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you

We‚Äôve known each other for so long
Your heart‚Äôs been aching but you‚Äôre too shy to say it
Inside we both know what‚Äôs been going on
We know the game and we‚Äôre gonna play it

And if you ask me how I‚Äôm feeling
Don‚Äôt tell me you‚Äôre too blind to see

Never gonna give you up
Never gonna let you down
Never gonna run around and desert you
Never gonna make you cry
Never gonna say goodbye
Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you
